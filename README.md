# AirPlay-Instruments

**AirPlay Instruments** is a capstone project dedicated to enhancing the accessibility, ease of use, and expressiveness of musical instruments for musicians of all levels. By leveraging computer vision, radar technology, and MIDI interfaces, we aim to develop an all-in-one HCI tool that allows users to input musical information with ease, whether they are traveling musicians, producers, or beginners exploring music without the need for expensive production tools (e.g., MIDI controller keyboards, pads, actual instruments, microphones, etc.).
