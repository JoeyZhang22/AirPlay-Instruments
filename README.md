# AirPlay-Instruments

Air Play instruments is a capstone project dedicated to improving the accessibility, ease of usage, and expression of music instruments for musicians from all walks of life. 
In this project, we will leverage computer vision, radar technology, and midi interface to create an all in one HCI tool that allow users to input musical information with ease.

Our target users are travelling musicians, producers, and people looking to learn about music without having to pay for expensive production tools (i.e midi controller keyboards, pads, actual instruments, microphones, and etc.)
